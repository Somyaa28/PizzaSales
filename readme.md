# Pizza Sales Report Project

This project involves analyzing pizza sales data using SQL queries and visualizing the results with an interactive dashboard in Power BI. The goal is to gain insights into the sales trends and identify the best and worst-selling pizzas.

## Project Overview

1. *Data Analysis with SQL*
   - We used SQL Server Management Studio 19 to run various queries and calculate key metrics.
   - The queries were used to extract and process data related to daily and monthly sales trends, sales percentages by category and size, and the total number of pizzas sold by category.

2. *Interactive Dashboard with Power BI*
   - The processed data was imported into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard.
   - The dashboard consists of two main reports:
     - *Home Report*: Displays daily and monthly sales trends, percentage sales by category and size, and total pizzas sold by category.
     - *Best/Worst Sellers Report*: Displays top and bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity, and order count.

## Dashboard Details

### Home Report
The Home report includes the following charts:

1. *Daily Trend of Orders*: A line chart showing the number of orders received each day.
2. *Monthly Trend of Orders*: A line chart displaying the number of orders received each month.
3. *Percentage Sales by Category*: A pie chart showing the percentage of total sales attributed to each pizza category.
4. *Percentage Sales by Size*: A pie chart displaying the percentage of total sales by pizza size.
5. *Total Pizzas Sold by Category*: A bar chart showing the total number of pizzas sold for each category.

### Best/Worst Sellers Report
The Best/Worst Sellers report includes:

1. *Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue*: A bar chart showing the top 5 pizzas that generated the highest revenue.
2. *Top 5 Pizzas by Quantity*: A bar chart displaying the top 5 pizzas sold in the highest quantities.
3. *Top 5 Pizzas by Orders*: A bar chart showing the top 5 pizzas with the highest number of orders.
4. *Bottom 5 Pizzas by Revenue*: A bar chart displaying the bottom 5 pizzas that generated the least revenue.
5. *Bottom 5 Pizzas by Quantity*: A bar chart showing the bottom 5 pizzas sold in the lowest quantities.
6. *Bottom 5 Pizzas by Orders*: A bar chart displaying the bottom 5 pizzas with the lowest number of orders.

## How to Use

1. *SQL Queries*: The SQL queries used for data analysis are available in the sql_queries directory.
2. *Power BI Dashboard*: The Power BI dashboard file (PizzaSalesDashboard.pbix) can be found in the dashboard directory. Open this file in Power BI Desktop to view and interact with the dashboard.
